Very fake, and possibly also gay snake game that I made in about 6 or so hours in C++ and ncurses. you can change the snake's speed (type h after the executable to see all speeds) and the snake can loop around the edges of the map.

COMPATIBLE WITH:
Linux
Might also compile on Mac and BSD (since they're ompatible with ncurses, so it should* compile in theory)

**V1.1.0: The Graphics Update mk.1**
- Added an outer barrier to the game-area
- Centered the game window

**V1.1.1: Patches and maintainence**
- Fixed .gitignore
- fixed an issue where the program would crash due to not checking if argc was less than 2
