Very fake, and possibly also gay snake game that I made in about 6 or so hours in C++ and ncurses. you can change the snake's speed (type h after the executable to see all speeds) and the snake can loop around the edges of the map.

COMPATIBLE WITH:
Linux
I see no reason it wouldn't compile on Mac and BSD, but you might have to change some

**v1.1: The Graphics Update mk.1**
- Added an outer barrier to the game-area
- Centered the game window
